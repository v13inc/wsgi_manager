file \- Sets attributes of files
." ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sets attributes of files, symlinks, and directories, or removes files/symlinks/directories. Many other modules support the same options as the \fIfile\fR module - including \fIcopy\fR, \fItemplate\fR, and \fIassemble\fR. 
." ------ OPTIONS
."
."
.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP context
accepts only \fCdefault\fR as value. This will restore a file's SELinux context in the policy. Does nothing if no default value is available.
.IR Choices :
default.   
.IP group
name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to \fIchown\fR   
.IP mode
mode the file or directory should be, such as 0644 as would be fed to \fIchmod\fR   
.IP owner
name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to \fIchown\fR   
.IP path
defines the file being managed, unless when used with \fCstate=link\fR, and then sets the destination to create a symbolic link to using \fIsrc\fR(required)   
.IP selevel
level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the \fCrange\fR. \fC_default\fR feature works as for \fIseuser\fR. (default: s0)   
.IP serole
role part of SELinux file context, \fC_default\fR feature works as for \fIseuser\fR.   
.IP setype
type part of SELinux file context, \fC_default\fR feature works as for \fIseuser\fR.   
.IP seuser
user part of SELinux file context. Will default to system policy, if applicable. If set to \fC_default\fR, it will use the \fCuser\fR portion of the policy if available   
.IP src
path of the file to link to (applies only to \fCstate=link\fR).   
.IP state
If \fCdirectory\fR, all immediate subdirectories will be created if they do not exist. If \fCfile\fR, the file will NOT be created if it does not exist, see the \fIcopy\fR or \fItemplate\fR module if you want that behavior. If \fClink\fR, the symbolic link will be created or changed. If \fCabsent\fR, directories will be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will be unlinked.
.IR Choices :
file,link,directory,absent. (default: file)."
