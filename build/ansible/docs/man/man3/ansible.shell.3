." ------ NOTES
.SH NOTES
.PP
If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be better to use the \fIcommand\fR module instead. Best practices when writing playbooks will follow the trend of using \fIcommand\fR unless \fIshell\fR is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement.
