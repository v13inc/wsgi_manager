.SH NAME
pause \- Pause playbook execution
." ------ DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Pauses playbook execution for a set amount of time, or until a prompt is acknowledged. All parameters are optional. The default behavior is to pause with a prompt. 
.PP
You can use \fCctrl+c\fR if you wish to advance a pause earlier than it is set to expire or if you need to abort a playbook run entirely. To continue early: press \fCctrl+c\fR and then \fCc\fR. To abort a playbook: press \fCctrl+c\fR and then \fCa\fR. 
.PP
The pause module integrates into async/parallelized playbooks without any special considerations (see also: Rolling Updates). When using pauses with the \fCserial\fR playbook parameter (as in rolling updates) you are only prompted once for the current group of hosts.
