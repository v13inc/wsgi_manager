.SH OPTIONS
   
.IP dest
Absolute path of where the repository should be cloned to.(required)

yes,no. (default: yes)   
.IP repo
The repository location.(required)   
.IP revision
Equivalent \fC-r\fR option in hg command, which can either be a changeset number or a branch name. (default: default)   
.IP state
\fChg clone\fR is performed when state is set to \fCpresent\fR. \fChg pull\fR and \fChg update\fR is performed when state is set to \fClatest\fR. If you want the latest copy of the repository, just rely on \fCpresent\fR. \fClatest\fR assumes the repository is already on disk.

present,absent,latest. (default: present)."
."
." ------ NOTES
.SH NOTES
.PP
If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in \fCknown_hosts\fR. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host. One solution is to add \fCStrictHostKeyChecking no\fR in \fC.ssh/config\fR which will accept and authorize the connection on behalf of the user. However, if you run as a different user such as setting sudo to True), for example, root will not look at the user .ssh/config setting.
